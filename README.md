# recommendation-system
 AI-based system that suggests relevant items (products, movies, music, etc.) to users based on their preferences and behavior. It is widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content discovery applications.

About Dataset
E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart use recommendation models to personalize user suggestions. Amazon employs item-to-item collaborative filtering, which matches users' purchased and rated items with similar items to generate recommendations efficiently.
In this project, we will build a recommendation model for Amazon's Electronics products using the Electronics dataset from the Amazon Reviews Data.
Dataset Attributes:
userId – Unique ID for each user.
productId – Unique ID for each product.
Rating – User's rating for the product.
Timestamp – Time of the rating.

A Recommender System is an AI-based system that suggests relevant items (products, movies, music, etc.) to users based on their preferences and behavior. It is widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and content discovery applications.

Types of Recommender Systems
Content-Based Filtering (CBF) – Suggests items similar to those a user has interacted with using item features.
Collaborative Filtering (CF) – Recommends items based on user-user or item-item similarities using past interactions.
Hybrid Recommendation – Combines multiple approaches (CBF + CF) for better accuracy.
Knowledge-Based – Uses domain knowledge and rules to suggest items, often used in specialized fields.
Reinforcement Learning-Based – Continuously learns and adapts recommendations using user feedback.

In this project, we use Matrix Factorization techniques, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to build an electronics product recommendation system.

SVD decomposes the user-item rating matrix into lower-dimensional matrices, capturing latent factors for better recommendations. It helps in handling sparse data efficiently and improving recommendation accuracy.

By applying SVD, we predict missing ratings and suggest relevant products to users based on learned preferences.
